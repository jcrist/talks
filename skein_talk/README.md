## Skein: A simpler way to deploy applications on Apache YARN

This was a talk given for [PyData NYC 2018](https://pydata.org/nyc2018/).  It
presents the what and why behind [Skein](https://jcrist.github.io/skein/), a
tool and library for deploying applications on Apache YARN. It also discusses
the micro-projects that spun out of this work. The following tools are
discussed:

- [`skein`](https://jcrist.github.io/skein/): Schedule and manage yarn applications

- [`conda-pack`](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/): Package conda environments for redistribution

- [`venv-pack`](https://jcrist.github.io/venv-pack/): Package virtual environments for redistribution

- [`dask-yarn`](http://dask-yarn.readthedocs.io/): Run dask on YARN

- [`hadoop-test-cluster`](https://github.com/jcrist/hadoop-test-cluster): Test your code against a realistic hadoop cluster
