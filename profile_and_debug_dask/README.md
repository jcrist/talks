## Make it Work, Make it Right, Make it Fast - Debugging and Profiling in Dask

This is a talk given for [PyData Seattle 2017](https://pydata.org/seattle2017/)
and [SciPy 2017](https://scipy2017.scipy.org/). Most of the talk was a live
demo, and the materials may not be very interesting on their own. I'll add a
link to the videos once they're published.

Slides can be viewed [here](http://jcrist.github.io/talks/profile_and_debug_dask/slides.html).

The data used in the examples is located
[here](https://github.com/jcrist/dask-tutorial-pydata-seattle-2017/blob/master/data/nycflights.tar.gz).
