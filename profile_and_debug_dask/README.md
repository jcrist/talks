## Make it Work, Make it Right, Make it Fast - Debugging and Profiling in Dask

This is a talk given for [PyData Seattle
2017](https://pydata.org/seattle2017/). Most of the talk was a live demo, and
the materials may not be very interesting on their own. I'll add a link to the
video once it's published.

Slides can be viewed [here](http://jcrist.github.io/talks/profile_and_debug_dask/slides.html).

The data used in the examples is located
