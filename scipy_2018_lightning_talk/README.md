## Deploying Python on YARN

This was a lightning talk given for [Scipy 2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/).
It was a brief overview of some tools/libraries I've developed for deploying
Python in the Hadoop ecosystem.

The tools:

- [`conda-pack`](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/): Package conda environments for redistribution

- [`skein`](https://jcrist.github.io/skein/): Schedule and manage yarn applications

- [`dask-yarn`](http://dask-yarn.readthedocs.io/): Run dask on YARN

- [`hadoop-test-cluster`](https://github.com/jcrist/hadoop-test-cluster): Test your code against a realistic hadoop cluster
