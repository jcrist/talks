# Cluster Manager

- In charge of deploying dask schedulers/workers on cluster backend

- Many different implementations
  - [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.dask.org)
  - [YARN](https://yarn.dask.org)
  - [HPC Job queues](https://jobqueue.dask.org)
  - [Cloud Providers (EC2, ...)](https://cloudprovider.dask.org)
  - ...

- Standard interface:

  ```python
  # Scale to n workers
  cluster.scale(n)

  # Adaptively scale between min and max workers
  cluster.adapt(min, max)
  ```


---

# Cluster Manager - Example

Example using [`dask-yarn`](http://yarn.dask.org/en/latest/)

```python
# Create a cluster backed by YARN
from dask_yarn import YarnCluster
cluster = YarnCluster(
    environment='environment.tar.gz',
    worker_vcores=2,
    worker_memory="8GiB",
)

# Scale to 2 workers
cluster.scale(2)

# Connect to the cluster
from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client(cluster)

# Application code...
import dask.dataframe as dd
df = dd.read_parquet(...)
...
```

---

>>> cluster = KubeCluster(...)
```

**YARN**: [`dask-yarn`](https://yarn.dask.org)

```python
>>> from dask_yarn import YarnCluster
>>> cluster = YarnCluster(...)
```

**HPC Clusters**: [`dask-jobqueue`](https://jobqueue.dask.org)

```python
>>> from dask_jobqueue import PBSCluster
>>> cluster = PBSCluster(...)
```

# Status Quo - Pros

- Deployment is part of user's code, no need for extra CLI tools.
  - Work from scripts, notebooks, applications, etc...

- No need for extra infrastructure, plays well with deployment backends

- Just python libraries - easy to install

- Extensible design, anyone can make a backend

---

# Status Quo - Cons

- Requires domain-specific knowledge of backend
  - Difficult for new users

- Users must have permissions and network access for cluster backend
  - May require users have excessive permissions, security risk
  - Client usually must be on same system as scheduler/workers

- No central management
  - Must rely on backend for tracking user actions and resource usage
  - Hard to enforce good practices

- Clusters are tied to lifetime of client
  - Restart your notebook, restart the cluster

</span>

---

# Dask-Gateway

- REST api for managing clusters

- Proxy for client to scheduler traffic (TLS)

- Proxy for dashboards (HTTP)

- Flexible design
  - Configurable backend (Kubernetes, YARN, HPC, ...)
  - Configurable authentication (Kerberos, JupyterHub, ...)

- Most actions done server-side (simple client, more complicated server)

---

# Using Dask-Gateway

```python
# Previous example using dask-yarn...
# Create a cluster backed by YARN
from dask_yarn import YarnCluster
cluster = YarnCluster(
    environment='environment.tar.gz',
    worker_vcores=2,
    worker_memory="8GiB",
)

# Scale to 2 workers
cluster.scale(2)

# Connect to the cluster
from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client(cluster)

# Application code...
import dask.dataframe as dd
df = dd.read_parquet(...)
...
```

---

# Using Dask-Gateway

```python
# Same example using dask-gateway
# Create a cluster backed by dask-gateway
from dask_gateway import GatewayCluster
cluster = GatewayCluster(
    address="https://mygateway.address.com",
    worker_vcores=2,
    worker_memory="8GiB",
)

# Scale to 2 workers
cluster.scale(2)

# Connect to the cluster
from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client(cluster)

# Application code...
import dask.dataframe as dd
df = dd.read_parquet(...)
...
```

# Internals

---

class: center, middle

**Currently being rewritten*

---

# Internals - Highlights

- Server written in Python using `aiohttp`

- Proxy written in Go

- Traitlets heavily used for configuration

---

# Traitlets!

- Declarative

- Automatic validation

- Configuration as code

- Same config as Jupyter ecosystem (https://github.com/ipython/traitlets)

---

# Traitlets - Example

```python
from traitlets.config import Configurable
from traitlets import Float

class Rectangle(Configurable):
    width = Float(
        1,
        min=0,
        help="The width of the rectangle in meters",
        config=True,
    )

    height = Float(
        1,
        min=0,
        help="The height of the rectangle in meters",
        config=True,
    )

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
```

---

# Traitlets - Example

**Configuration**

```python
# config.py
c.Rectangle.width = 10
c.Rectangle.height = 25
```

**Usage**

```python
>>> r = Rectangle(config=c)
>>> r.width
10
>>> r.height
25
>>> r.area()
250
```

---

# Traitlets - Validation

**Configuration**

```python
# config.py
c.Rectangle.width = 10
c.Rectangle.height = -1  # invalid value
```

**Usage**

```python
>>> r = Rectangle(config=c)
...
TraitError: The value of the 'height' trait of a Rectangle instance
should not be less than 0, but a value of -1.0 was specified
```

---

# Traitlets - Custom logic

```python
# config.py
import sys

# Support wider rectangles on windows:
if sys.platform == "win32":
    c.Rectangle.width = 20
else:
    c.Rectangle.width = 10

c.Rectangle.height = 10
```

# Configurable Backends

- Wanted support for multiple backends

  - Kubernetes
  - YARN
  - HPC Job Queues
  - ...

---

# Configurable Backends

- Wanted support for multiple backends

  - Kubernetes
  - YARN
  - HPC Job Queues
  - ...

- Solution:
  - Abstract backend-specifics out into a base class
  - Implement class for various backends
  - Make backend class configurable using
  [`traitlets.Type`](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/trait_types.html#traitlets.Type).

---

# Backend Base Class

- See
[`dask_gateway_server.backends.base`](https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/blob/master/dask-gateway-server/dask_gateway_server/backends/base.py)
for full definition.

```python
class Backend(LoggingConfigurable):
    async def setup(self, app):
        """Setup the backend, called on startup"""

    async def cleanup(self):
        """Cleanup the backend, called on shutdown"""

    async def list_clusters(self, username=None, statuses=None):
        """List clusters, with optional filtering"""

    async def get_cluster(self, cluster_name, wait=False):
        """Lookup a cluster"""

    async def start_cluster(self, user, cluster_options):
        """Submit a new cluster."""

    async def stop_cluster(self, cluster_name, failed=False):
        """Stop a cluster."""

    async def on_cluster_heartbeat(self, cluster_name, msg):
        """Handle heartbeats from the cluster."""
```

---

# DataBase-backed Backend Base Class

- Backend implementation that uses a database to store state
- See
[`dask_gateway_server.backends.db_base`](https://github.com/dask/dask-gateway/blob/master/dask-gateway-server/dask_gateway_server/backends/db_base.py)
for full definition.

```python
class DBBackendBase(Backend):
    async def do_start_cluster(self, cluster):
        """Start a cluster."""

    async def do_stop_cluster(self, cluster):
        """Stop a cluster."""

    async def do_check_clusters(self, clusters):
        """Check the status of multiple clusters."""

    async def do_start_worker(self, worker):
        """Start a worker."""

    async def do_stop_worker(self, worker):
        """Stop a worker."""

    async def do_check_workers(self, workers):
        """Check the status of multiple workers."""
```

---

# Backend - Configuration

```python
# Use the Kubernetes backend
c.DaskGateway.backend_class = "dask_gateway_server.backends.kubernetes.KubeBackend"

# Specify which base image to use
c.KubeClusterConfig.image = "myuser/my-dask-gateway-image:latest"

# Specify worker resources
c.KubeClusterConfig.worker_cores = 2
c.KubeClusterConfig.worker_memory = "8 G"

...
```

---

# Scheduler Proxy

- Dask uses raw TCP to communicate

- Most proxies either:
  - Proxy HTTP (level 7), dispatching on the path in the HTTP request
  - Proxy TCP (level 4) to a static address

- We need to proxy TLS (encrypted TCP) to *multiple* backends
  - Could include routing in each message, but would need to have proxy decrypt
  traffic (expensive)

---

# Solution: Use SNI

- SNI (Server Name Indication)

  > "an extension to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) computer networking
    protocol by which a client indicates which hostname it is attempting to
    connect to at the start of the handshaking process."
    ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication))

- Allows routing TLS *encrypted* traffic based on an *unencrypted* field in
  handshake

---

# Scheduler Proxy

- On each connection:

  - Extract handshake message, extract SNI

  - Check SNI, rejecting clients with invalid SNIs

  - Connect to backend for specified SNI

  - Replay extracted handshake to backend

  - Copy bytes between sockets until connection closes (fast!)

---

<img src="../images/golang-gopher.svg" width=20% style="float: right">

# Scheduler Proxy

- Written in [Go](https://golang.org/)

  - Needed some low-level bytes handling

  - Good support for handling many clients

  - Stdlib had features that made this easier to write (~1000 lines total)

  - Also wanted an excuse to write some Go

- For K8s backend rewrite we're using [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io) instead

---

<img src="../images/golang-gopher.svg" width=20% style="float: right">

# Scheduler Proxy

- Bundled with the `dask-gateway-server` wheel:

  - Wanted an easy install

  - Added as "package-data" ([setuptools
  docs](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#including-data-files))
  
```python
# setup.py
setup(
    ...,
    package_data={"dask_gateway_server": ["proxy/dask-gateway-proxy"]},
    ...
)
```

# Conclusion

---

# Dask-Gateway

- **Centrally Managed**
  - Admins do the heavy lifting, users get easy cluster access.

- **Secure by default**
  - Automatic TLS everywhere, no elevated user permissions.

- **Flexible**
  - Configurable backends, authentication, etc...

- **Robust to Failure**
  - Can be restarted or failover without losing existing clusters.

---

# Dask-Gateway

- Designed with *institutional* users/teams in mind

- Previous deployment options still quite useful, and may be preferred for
individuals and small teams.

---

# Ongoing Work

- Finishing up the rewrite
  - Re-adding Kubernetes backend
  - Testing
  - Documentation

- Web UI
  - Authentication
  - Dashboarding
  - Admin panel

- User driven features (come talk to me/file an issue)
